### What Accessibility Options does the user need?

Nothing for this specific user, however need to consider that the app has a broader demographic. Look at options for visually and hearing impaired users.

### What type of notification would you like have? Messages, email or alarm?

Not an alarm. Only messages with the option to receive emails.

### Would you like to be able to add priority levels to your medications?

2 Emergency prescriptions should be allowed per year, via 111, and important medication should always be ordered in advance

### Do you want your prescriptions automatically renewed or do you want to renew it manually?

"Ideally it is renewed automatically however, if there is an issue with the prescription such as my usual pharmacy not having the prescription available, I want to have the option to select the nearest pharamacy that has the prescription"

### Are You old enough to order the prescription or would you need supervision (would you like to order prescriptions for someone underaged)?

"I am old enough to order the medicine for myself, but i would like a feature that allows me to order prescriptions for my 3 year old daughter, but have to be authorised by the GP each time."

### Should the app include images of the specified medication/prescription?

In regards to this user it is not necessary however some may find it more comforting to have a 1-to-1 picture of what
their medicine may look like in order to ensure they are being given the correct one. As in some instances it may be difficult to determine the correct one purely through the name of the medication due to some being similar.
